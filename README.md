# Paxos

We are building an implementation of [multi-Paxos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29#Multi-Paxos) that can be used to maintain a number of [replicated state machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication).

This is our project for [CS5412](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5412/2014sp/) at Cornell.
