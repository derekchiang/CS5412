# Paxos

This project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/derekchiang/CS5412).

We are building an implementation of [multi-Paxos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29#Multi-Paxos) that can be used to maintain a number of [replicated state machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication).

This is our project for [CS5412](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5412/2014sp/) at Cornell.

## Status

Work in progress.

## Build

You will need to have [Rust 0.10](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) and [Busybee](https://github.com/rescrv/busybee) installed.  A guide to install Busybee can be found [here](https://github.com/rescrv/busybee/pull/9/files).

Then, just `make`.  Some examples will be placed under `bin/`.
